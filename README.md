# Bank_Accounts_Application
:+1: Application to perform the main functionalities in a financial institution

This application performs main functionalities in a bank:

-depositing

-withdrawing

-transfering balances from one account to different parties

-generating the informations about the account holders

I am using interface as a mandatory requirement from the bank.

I am reading .csv file of clients including names, social security numbers, account types, and initial deposit(which is attached in the folder).

The account number is being generated by the following methodology: 1 or 2, depending the type of account, last 2 digits of SSN, followed by an uniwue 5 digit number id and random 3 digit number.

Both Savings and Checking accounts implement the IRate interface where savings account use a 0.25 percent less that the rate and checkings use 0.15 percent of the rate.
